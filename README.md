## Standardized Architecture for NIST High-Impact Controls on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start extends the [NIST Quick Start](https://fwd.aws/8GxB7) to help support:

* NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 4) high-impact security controls baseline
* CNSS Instruction 1253
* NIST SP 800-171
* FedRAMP and TIC Overlay (pilot)
* DoD Cloud Computing SRG

The Quick Start template automatically configures the AWS resources and deploys a multi-tier, Linux-based web application in a few simple steps, in about an hour. The Quick Start features Deep Security from Trend Micro for host-based protection. The [security controls matrix](https://fwd.aws/kRRgp) (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) shows how the Quick Start components map to security requirements.
